What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","    --> Python is a high level programining lenguage used to give command which computer can execute.It is used widely for  Web developement, Machine learning, Data analytics, automation. It's Popular because of easy syntax, easy to write and learn code, world wide community support, open source, multiple librabries with pre-written code etc.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","    --> Interpreter is a computer program which convert python code into machine language and helps to execute the python code.\n","  \n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","    --> Pre-defined words which hold the special meaning and have specific purpose in python programing are knows as pre defined keywords.\n","    for example: If, else, print, false, true, and , not etc.\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","    --> We can not use pre defined keywords as variable name because they hold special meaning in python programming language. If we use then code will not execute and will through syntax error.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","    --> If we can update or modify any object after creation known as mutable object and this ability of object is known as mutability. example of mulatble objects are list, sets, dictionaries.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","    --> Item or values in list can be change or update that's why list is muatble whereas tuples are immutable because we can not update tupple items.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","    --> \"==\" is known as Equality  operator which is used to compare the value of two objects.\n","    \"is\" operator is used to identify that two variables are point to same object or not. It's known as Identify operator.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","    --> \"and\", \"or\" and \"not\" are the logical operators in python which helps to perform operations based on multiple conditions in single statement.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","    --> Converting variable's data type to other data type is known as type casting.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","    --> Type casting done automatically by python in result of any operation is known as \"implicit\" type casting. whereas if we are intentionally chnaging type of any object using type functions like int(), float(), str() in code then it's known as explicit type casting.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","    --> Conditional statement is used to execute code by passing one or many conditions in it. for example : if, else, elif.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","    --> elif is allow user to apply multiple conditions and execute in downwards direction. means it will execute all conditional line by line untill the condition pass. if condition will not pass untill last elif statement then it will check for else statement.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","    --> for loop will iterate the statement over specified sequence. wheras while loop will iterate the statements while a condition is true.\n","  \n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","    --> While loop is majourly used in scenarios where iterations are not predifined and will iterate untill the condition will not get fail. for example we ahve 100 train tickets and we have to sell all. Tickets are applicable for more than 5 year old whereas less tahn 5 year old can do free travel. In that case we will iterate the loop untill 100 pasangers more than 5 year old will not get ticket.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FXJ0zsVaKB5B"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Practical
